# Overview

This repository is intended as an electronic laboratory notebook to help document and organize my computational research. There will not be much source code included in the repository, however input scripts for quantum and/or classic MD simulations will be saved using version control. I am going to use the wiki to annotate the repo, so when in doubt check the wiki.

# Contributors

For others kind enough to help with my work please feel free to edit the markdown files directly using the github web interface, and comment on the wiki. Thanks in advance.
