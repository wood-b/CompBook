# Mg ion in an ether cage

## Method
Molecule cage for Mg was made in IQmol and the energy of the structure was minimized using a UFF potential. The molecule cage is not intended to be a realistic structure, the purpose to see if coordination is causing convergence issues.

Level of Theory
* HF
* 3-21G

## Result
The system converged

## Input Change 0
Since the system converged as a single point energy, try geometry optimization

The system didn't find an equilibrium geometry before the maximum optimization cycle was reached, but the distance between a number of ether oxygens and Mg ion decreased to ~2 Angstroms (hard to see in 2D images, easy to see in 3D)
