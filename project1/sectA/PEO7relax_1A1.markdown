# PEO oligomer N=7 relaxation

## Methods
The linear chain was created in IQmol and initially relaxed using the built in UFF potential. One chain end is methyl terminated the other is hydroxyl terminated

Level of theory
* B3LYP
Basis set
* 6-31G\*

## Issues
The resulting optimized geometry tends to remain similar to the arbitrarily chosen initial configuration (i.e. linear chain). Is that a reasonable low energy structure?
