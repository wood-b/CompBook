# PEO oligomer N=7 and Mg+2 ion geometry optimization

## Method
The relaxed chain coordinates were taken from 1A1 and a Mg ion was added 2 Angstroms from one of the third ether oxygen

Level of theory
* Functional: BLYP 
* Basis Set: 3-21++G

## Issues
Self consistent field calculation did not converge.

## Ideas
Reasons it did not converge:
* In vacuum
* Mg not coordinated properly
* Charged system
* ???
